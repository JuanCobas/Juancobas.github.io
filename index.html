            I have a computer in my house since I can remeber. And I have been playing videogames since forever too, I can ever remeber the first videogame I played: School Bus Driver &trade;.
            Yes... with the &trade;.
            <br>
            Since then and through the years my passion for videogames has wear off a bit. I still love it but one has other responsibilities.

            Three years ago I decided that playing too much videogames and not doing any kind of sports wasn't good for my healt. I started hitting the gym regularly and through time I not only improved my physique but learned a lot about my body and my healt. 
            <br>
            Today I know that being healty is not only eating a salad and doing exersice once in a while, it is a lifestyle.
